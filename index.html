                <h3>In a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arj7oStGLkU" target="_blank">TED Talk from Tim Urban</a> , he showed a chart with 3718 blocks, which is the number of weeks in the average human life span. He used this to demonstrate how even though some life goals are easier to procrastinate on because they don't have deadlines, there's a pretty inevitable one that's looming over our heads.</h3>
                
                <h3>Here's how many weeks you've used so far:</h3>
